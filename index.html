  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 3, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for choosing SoraPetku. Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how SoraPetku and its affiliates (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the “Services”). By using SoraPetku, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>We collect information to provide and improve the Services, to communicate with you, and to personalize your experience. The categories of information we collect include:</p>

  <h3>1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information:</strong> When you register for an account or sign in, we may collect your name, email address, password (securely hashed), and any profile information you choose to provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Pet information:</strong> Details about your pet(s), such as name, breed, age, medical history, vaccination records, feeding preferences, and behavioral notes, when you add this information to the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Any messages, support requests, feedback, or other content you send to us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>

    <li><strong>Device and technical data:</strong> Device model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, browser type, IP address, and app version.</li>
    <li><strong>Location data:</strong> With your permission, we may collect precise or approximate device location to enable location-based features (for example, finding nearby vets or pet services). You can control location permissions in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
  <p>With your consent, we may receive information about you from third-party services (for example, sign-in providers or integrations). We will treat this information in the same way as information you provide directly.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

  <p>We use collected information for the following purposes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide and operate the Services:</strong> To deliver core features such as pet profiles, reminders, and records management.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To tailor content, recommendations, notifications, and user experience based on your preferences and pet information.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> To send account-related messages, updates, security alerts, and marketing messages when you opt in.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and improvement:</strong> To analyze usage trends, diagnose technical issues, and improve functionality and performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety and security:</strong> To detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, abuse, security incidents, and other malicious activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from public authorities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (If Applicable)</h2>

  <p>For users located in jurisdictions with data protection laws that require a legal basis for processing (such as the EU’s GDPR), our legal bases include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Performance of a contract (providing the Services you requested);</li>
    <li>Your consent (for optional features such as marketing and precise location);</li>
    <li>Legitimate interests (for product improvement, analytics, and fraud prevention), provided those interests are not overridden by your rights; and</li>
    <li>Compliance with legal obligations where required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information as described below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We share information with vendors who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting, analytics, payment processing, and customer support. These providers are contractually bound to protect your data and use it only for the services they perform.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party integrations:</strong> If you connect SoraPetku with third-party services (e.g., wellness providers, veterinary clinics, or social sharing), those services may receive information about you and your pet. Sharing is subject to your explicit authorization.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with laws, respond to lawful requests by public authorities, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SoraPetku, our users, or others.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will notify you if your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

  <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When information is no longer needed, we take reasonable steps to securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

  <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

  <p>We and our service providers use cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacons and local storage) to collect information about your activity on the Services and to improve user experience. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser or device settings. Disabling certain cookies may limit your ability to use some features.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>

  <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption in transit, access controls, and regular security assessments. No system can be completely secure; while we work to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

When we transfer personal information across borders, we use appropriate safeguards required by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>11. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>

  <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services that we do not control. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you use. We are not responsible for the privacy or other practices of third parties.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated policy with a new effective date and, where appropriate, provide additional notice (for example, in-app notification). Continued use of the Services after the revised policy takes effect constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>13. International Users</h2>

  <p>If you are accessing the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States. The data protection laws where you live may differ from those in the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to such transfers.</p>
